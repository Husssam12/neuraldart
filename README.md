# neuraldart
A Dart library for Neural Networks

I created this repo as an exercise while learning Dart Programming. Writing this library was very fun. There are also other (maybe even better) implementations like [ai](https://github.com/YevhenKap/ai) and [Dartnet](https://github.com/richardjuan/dartnet).

This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details. If you found mistake or have any advice, feel free to open an issue.

Thanks to [@yacineMahdid](https://github.com/yacineMahdid) for backpropagation algorithm.

## Usage
I wrote the [XOR Problem](example/main.dart) as an example. You can tweak it for your own dataset.
